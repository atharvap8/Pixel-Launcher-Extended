### Troubleshooting
If you face any issues while using Pixel Launcher Extended then look into this section first before asking in the Telegram support group.
- Weather widget on "At A Glance" or "Select Feature" of Pixel Launcher is not working? Then try updating Google App, Google Play Services, Android System Intelligence (ASI), Android System WebView, Google Calendar, Google Lens and all other Google apps from Play Store. I will suggest you to use those ROMs that have Pixel Gapps by default.
- If it still doesn't work after trying the above solution, or if you are facing random crashes in launcher then download [Add-On At A Glance Enhancer](#Add-ons). It contains Android System Intelligence(Which will fix all these issues).
- If your ROM has Its own implementation of Monet/"Material You" and it's interfering with Pixel Launcher's Monet/Material You & due to it Material You isn't working properly & it's not changing color according to wallpaper then follow this:
  - [Download Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/). Open it & type the command given below & press enter. Give root access. After finishing this process, reboot the device once.
```bash
su -c settings delete secure theme_customization_overlay_packages
``` 
- You enabled “Hide Clock” from the Pixel Launcher Mods app? And now the clock isn't returning after disabling it? [Check this video](https://index.teamfiles.workers.dev/0:/clock%20fix.mp4) to fix this issue.
- If Pixel Launcher mods app stucked at loading screen or it's saying root not found even if you gave it root permission then force stop this app once to fix this issue.
- If Pixel Launcher crashes while going to recent tab then turn off Overview suggestions from Pixel Launcher's settings.
- If you don't see Pixel Launcher Extended in default home settings & only launcher showing there is Original pixel launcher then uninstall updates of original pixel launcher.
